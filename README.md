### Train
Please download the pre-trained model weights and dataset first. Next, generate the path of the training set and the test set, and change the dataset path in the code to the path of the dataset you specified.

~~~python
python train.py
~~~

### Inference
Download the MTPNet model weights, create the necessary directories to store these files, and be sure to update the corresponding paths in the code accordingly. 

~~~python
python infer.py
~~~

### Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our LMWNet on ORSSDï¼ŒEORSSD and ORSI-4199 datasets.
